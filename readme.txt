To set up data:
go to: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CEuvvahWQntNIqXWZhXu_WknsTLm4Sum
download indoor_flying4_data.hdf5 and indoor_flying_gt.hdf5
place both files in the data folder.
Alternatively, if you can handle the space download outdoor_night1_data.hdf5 and outdoor_night1_gt.hdf5
files from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SV6nQ-ONQmLnCo3aVQFtO6NJ7yXfSmvT

To Run:
Make sure .npy files are downloaded, then run through main.py
Check code for several options for displaying image results
